        <h3>Rowing</h3>
        <p>This is my first year doing rowing at Texas Rowing Center, and I've really enjoyed it in many ways. 
            I love the intensity that is brought to every practice, and the teamwork that 
            is required for high performance. There's no individuality in an eight man boat, 
            and everyone is motivated to work as hard as they can at all times because they 
            know that everyone around them is doing the same. Below are some pictures from
            some of the regattas that I have competed in this season. Four of the pictures are
            taken from the Carsen Smith Regatta, which is a head-to-head race that Texas Rowing
            Center does every year against our rivals, Austin Rowing Club, who we share Townlake 
            with. The fifth picture is taken from one of my first regattas which was the Waco
            Regatta, which featured a long course that was done in a time trial format.</p>

        <h3>Classic NES Tetris</h3>
        <p>When COVID began in 2019 I started playing Tetris on an old NES clone console
            that I found in my attic. I found out there was a competitive scene and played
            matches throughout COVID. I was able to qualify for the online world championships
            in 2020, and at the time I was the youngest competitor to ever qualify, since I was
            only 12. I also competed in the world championships in 2021, and made it to the final
            of my bracket, placing me top 16 overall. Since 2022 the world championships have moved
            back to being in person, and I haven't been competing, and I haven't really had time to 
            play much in the past couple years, but I would still say it is my favorite game ever just 
            because of how much I've played it. I will link the video of my 2021 bracket final and put
            a video of me playing a game in 2023 at home.
