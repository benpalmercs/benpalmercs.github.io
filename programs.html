                <h6>This was the game I submitted for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. In this game you control
                    a small player trapped in a dungeon, and his goal is to get to the gold star. In order to get to the 
                    star, the player must jump from platform to platform and then navigate the halls without landing on any
                    spikes. When done the program will tell you how fast you were able to complete the game in seconds, so
                    challenge yourself to get a better time.

                <h6>This was my second game that I made with pygame and in it you can control a small basket at the bottom
                    of the screen, and try to capture as many falling chicks as possible. Everytime you catch a chick a new
                    one will spawn in a random place above your basket. The goal is to catch 80 chicks without missing more
                    than 10, but you'll find that the game gets a little harder once you've caught 50.

                <h2>Agario</h2>
                <iframe width = 45% height =200 src="./videos/Agario.mp4"></iframe>
                <h6>This was my first game that I made with Pygame. This is a simple clone of agar.io where the goal is to 
                    collect food pelets and grow large enough to consume the enemies on the screen. The player is controlled
                    by the mouse and the enemies move in straight lines, bouncing off of walls. The screen is pretty small so 
                    the game will be over pretty fast. Be sure that you're locked in and don't get eaten immediately.
